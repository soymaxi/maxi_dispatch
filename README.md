To translate the script just edit the strings from client, index.html and js.

**To add the rob trigger just add this where the rob is started (client-side):**

```
local pedcoords = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())
local id = GetPlayerServerId(PlayerId())
TriggerServerEvent("guille_dispatch:sendRobaAlert", "robo", pedcoords, id) --- Don't Change "robo" becouse is the code for identify the trigger
```
